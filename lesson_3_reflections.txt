When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to work with other people on that project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be experimenting with stuff that is not yet ready to be shared
    with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is a new line of development that allows you to experiment and
    try new changes before committing to them. A clone is a copy of a
    repository, either one you make locally or or one you make from an
    existing GitHub repository. A fork is a clone of a repository from
    GitHub into another (your) repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to know where you stand in relation with the state of that
    remote, whether you're ahead or behind, or out of sync, etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    With much difficulty. It would be a mess. All hail Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
