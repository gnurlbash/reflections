What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git creates a new hidden directory with metadata and stuff. Because 
    otherwise I wouldn't be able to use Git. Duh.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It's different in that it only contains the files that have been added to 
    it. It allows you to only commit certain files instead of all of them at 
    once.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    By adding only the file(s) that are necessary for that change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    Branches help by allowing you to make experimental changes that you don't
    necessarily want to include in the master branch yet.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git¿s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
