How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By allowing me to not have to check the whole thing myself.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By making it possible to easily restore the file to any previous version of it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you can choose the size of your commits and make them more logical. Cons:
    you can forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git needs to be able to save multiple files per commit because it is a tool
    oriented towards programmers, and making changes to multiple files that are
    logically related is fairly common in programming tasks. Google Docs is a
    more general tool that's not necessarily used for coding and so this makes
    less sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You use git log to see the history and git diff to compare two files. Duh.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By knowing that I can undo any boo-boos easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    A little personal programming project of mine.
